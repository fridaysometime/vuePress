# Getting started

## Overview

This guide walks through the steps of installing and configuring Studio and third-party SDKs and tools required to develop native mobile applications with Studio. If you prefer to use your own editor or IDE, you can integrate the Titanium command-line tools into your environment (see Setting up the Titanium CLI for instructions).

## Prerequisites

Your system environment must meet the following requirements to run Studio:

- **Operating System:** A recent version of Windows or Mac OS X
- **Memory:** 8 GB RAM minimum system memory (2 GB RAM available memory). 16 GB RAM recommended.
- **Java Runtime:** Oracle JDK (no other brand of Java is suitable)
- **Node.js:** Required for the Titanium command-line tools like the CLI, Alloy and API Runtime Services

::: tip
For Windows, you can use either 32-bit or 64-bit versions of Java JDK. Please refer to Studio Java Support for more information.
:::

For more details, please refer to [Prerequisites](./prerequisites.md) document.

For a complete list of compatibility of system environments, dependencies, and other requirements, please review the [Titanium Compatibility Matrix](./prerequisites.md#compatibility-matrix).

::: tip
By default, upon each launch, Studio asks you to select a workspace. To hide this dialog on subsequent launches, select the **Use this as the default and do not ask again option.**
:::

On the Studio launch screen, enter your AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services account credentials and click **Login**. Studio remembers your login credentials until you sign out of Studio.

::: tip
Studio requires an internet connection to authenticate the user to the Appcelerator cloud. If you are behind a proxy, click **Proxy Setup...** to configure your proxy settings.
